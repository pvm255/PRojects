knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Data spans for 10 years. Data is daily basis.

```{r}
timeseries_oil<- read.csv("C:/Users/priyanandana/Desktop/R/Timeseries/OIL.csv", 
                          header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
timeseries_gold<- read.csv("C:/Users/priyanandana/Desktop/R/Timeseries/table.csv", 
                           header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

Changing from Daily to Monthly

```{r}
library(hydroTSM)
m<- daily2monthly(timeseries_oil, FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE) 
timeseries_oil<- data.frame(m)
n<- daily2monthly(timeseries_gold, FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE) 
timeseries_gold<- data.frame(n)
```

Creating timeseries 

```{r}
ts.all_oil<-ts(timeseries_oil)
plot.ts(ts.all_oil)
ts.all_gold<-ts(timeseries_gold)
plot.ts(ts.all_gold)
```

Plotting both the timeseries on one chart 

```{r}
ts.s4_oil<-ts(timeseries_oil$Close, start = c(2006,8), frequency = 12)
plot(ts.s4_oil)

ts.s4_gold<-ts(timeseries_gold$Close, start = c(2006,8), frequency = 12)
plot(ts.s4_gold)

library(ggfortify)
ts.oil<-ts(ts.s4_oil)

ts.gold<-ts(ts.s4_gold)

autoplot(ts( cbind(ts.oil, ts.gold) , start = c(2006,0),end=c(2016,11), frequency = 12 ),facets = FALSE)
```

With Different Y axis

```{r}
autoplot(ts( cbind(ts.oil, ts.gold) , start = c(2006,0),end=c(2016,11), frequency = 12 ),facets = TRUE)

cor(ts.gold,ts.oil)
```

###This chart proves the negative correlation between GOLD & OIL which is of -0.556 
###Investment Strategy
### Having proven the negative correlation between oil and gold gives us a good idea on how to invest in gold vs oil. The oil forecast tells us that oil price is going to increase slightly next year while gold prices are going to stay similar. Recent events over the last decade or so like the efforts of the US to become energy independent by increasing oil extraction and subsequently Saudi Arabia reducing the price of oil have made oil prices plummet. Knowing the relationship between gold and oil we are quite certain that oil prices will soon bounce up and in turn, the price of gold fall. The forecasted small increase in oil prices indicate that oil prices are in fact on the way up even though we don't think they will go as high as they were around 10 years ago because of the enormous impact previous mentioned events have had on the prices and us being less an less dependent on oil.

### Our recommendation is that you take a position with the oil and benefit from the increase in oil prices over the next years or that you take up a short position in gold and benefit from the decrease in gold prices.

Forecasting Using an ARIMA model

```{r}
auto.arima(gold.sorted.ts)
gold.arima<-arima(gold.sorted.ts, c(1,1,1))   # this models is equivalent to ARMA(1,1,0)

###S&P 500 analysis and forecast


Load the data and explore.

```{r}
sp500 <- read.csv('C:/Users/priyanandana/Desktop/R/Timeseries/sp500_95.csv', header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
names(sp500)
head(sp500)
```

Sorting the data by date and creating a time series object.spans Data spans last 21 years up to Oct 31st 1995. Data is monthly (end of month). years. 

```{r}
sp500.sorted <- sp500[rev(order(as.Date(sp500$Date, format = "%y/%m/%d"))),]

sp500.sorted.ts <- ts(sp500.sorted$Close, start = c(1995), frequency = 12)

plot(sp500.sorted.ts,
     xlab = "Year",
     ylab = 'S&P 500 Index')
```

Decomposing data to three components: a trend, seasonal and irregular component.

```{r}
sp500.ts.dec <- decompose(sp500.sorted.ts)
plot(sp500.ts.dec)
```
On average there has been an upward trend in the index from 1995. In addition we have 5-7 year cycles (see trend/observed components). It looks like at this point in time the index has plateaued and will soon start falling if previous pattern is any indicator.

There seems to be high seasonality with primary peaks in Oct/Nov secondary peaks in Jul/Aug.

Exponential Smoothing
```{r}
sp500.ts.holt <- HoltWinters(sp500.sorted.ts, gamma=TRUE)
plot(sp500.ts.holt)
```

1 year forecast with Holt Winters

```{r}
library(forecast)
sp500.forecast <- forecast.HoltWinters(sp500.ts.holt, h = 12)
  plot(sp500.forecast,
       xlab = "Year",
       ylab = 'S&P 500 Index')
```

The model predicts a slight increase but the confidence interval indicates it could start falling.

Forecasting Using an ARIMA model

```{r}
sp500.arima <- arima(sp500.sorted.ts, c(1,1,1))
sp500.arima.forecast <- forecast.Arima(sp500.arima, h=12)
plot(sp500.arima.forecast)
```

Both models are not forecasting big change in the index. The Holt Winter forecasts a slight increase while the ARIMA model forecasts almost no change at all.

Based on historical cycles we can expect the index to fall soon. If you are looking to invest in S&P 500 stocks next year, there are a few things you have to keep in mind.

1. If you are looking to invest long term in the stocks I do not advice you to do it at this point in time. The stocks will soon go down and right now they are as high as they have been in years. We are in the middle of a cycle and if you wait for 2-3 years or until the cycle reaches its bottom you can expect to be able to buy cheap stocks with a high probability of increasing in value over the next 5-7 years.

2. If you want to try to capitalize on the falling index you can short the stocks now and then acquire them in about 2 years time based on cycles.

3. For small short term profits you can exploit the seasonality in the index. By buying stocks when they are cheap in Jan/Feb or Septemeber and then selling them in either Jul/August or Oct/Nov you can make marginal but quick profits. You can also short the stocks in the same manner and capitalize on the seasonal downhill slope.

My professional advice would be to not invest in S&P 500 today but rather in 2-3 years towards the end of the cycle and then sell at the the peak of the cycle, in 5-7 years time. If you have to invest then I would suggest shorting the stocks long term.

### Quantifying Variance
```{r}
library(timeSeries)
gold<- gold.sorted.ts[c(1:124,1)]
oil<- oil.sorted.ts[c(1:124,1)]
sp500<-sp500.sorted.ts[c(1:124,1)]

colVars(gold)
colVars(oil)
colVars(sp500)

###Variance is used to measure a stock's volatility. 
##Being able to express in a single number just how far a given stocks value can travel away from the mean is a very useful indicator of how much risk a particular stock comes with.
### Its really hard to predict for long term as the variance of GOLD and SP500 stocks is very high as compared to OIL.
